**Project Title: Air Quality Analysis and Visualization in ![](Aspose.Words.34dd2d5a-14a6-45e4-9b7f-ad1aacdc5e16.001.png)Tamil Nadu** 

**Introduction:** 

The aim of this project is to analyze and visualize air quality data collected from monitoring stations in Tamil Nadu, India. The primary objectives are to gain insights into air pollution trends, identify areas with high pollution levels, and develop a predictive model for estimating RSPM/PM10 levels based on SO2 and NO2 levels. This document outlines the design thinking process for the project, including project objectives, analysis approach, and visualization techniques.

**Data Collection**:  ![](Aspose.Words.34dd2d5a-14a6-45e4-9b7f-ad1aacdc5e16.003.png)

Obtain air quality data from monitoring stations in Tamil Nadu. The data should include parameters such as date, time, location, SO2 levels, NO2 levels, RSPM levels, and PM10 levels. 

`     `**Data Pre-processing**: 

- Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and duplicates. 
- Aggregate data by calculating daily, monthly, and yearly averages. 
- Create a dataset suitable for analysis and modeling. 

**Data Analysis**: 

- Calculate statistical measures to understand central tendencies and variations in pollutant levels. 
- Perform time series analysis to identify trends and seasonality in air quality data. 
- Conduct spatial analysis to identify areas with high pollution levels. 
- Explore correlations between different pollutants (e.g., SO2 vs. RSPM, NO2 vs. PM10). 

`      `**Data Visualization**: 

- Utilize appropriate visualization techniques to represent air quality trends, including line charts for time series analysis, heatmaps for hotspot identification, and scatter plots for correlation analysis. 
- Create interactive dashboards to allow users to explore air quality data visually.
